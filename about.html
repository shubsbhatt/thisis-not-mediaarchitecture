					<h3> About </h3> 
					<p> Media Architecture is considered a rather novel phenomenon that interconnects media and architecture in manifold ways. It is a field that encompasses quite diverse projects; yet due to its ambiguous nature, it is rather difficult to define. Therefore, as part of our master thesis, instead of providing a definition, we aim to find the core elements of Media Architecture, which, when combined, they provide a more holistic approach to the field. Combining these elements in a conceptual framework, we apply it to a number of projects to examine its validity. The results of our analysis are being presented in this prototype web platform. <br> <br></p>
					<p>
					This is (not) Media Architecture is the title of our master thesis, under the guidance of Vertetung der Professur Michael Markert and Dr.-Ing. Sabine Zierold. We are Shubhra Bhasker Bhatt, interaction designer, and Afroditi Manari, architect; both students of the program of M.Sc. MediaArchitecture, Bauhaus Universit√§t Weimar. The thesis was conducted in the summer semester of 2016|2017.
